### 🔐 User ↔ Role Assignment (Identity Integration)
The system uses ASP.NET Identity with these main tables:


- 🔹AspNetUsers

- 🔹AspNetRoles

AspNetUserRoles (relationship between users and roles)

Assigning a role to a user is done using:

-await _userManager.AddToRoleAsync(user, roleName);
To display user roles in the index page:

-await _userManager.IsInRoleAsync(user, roleName);

### 💡 Future Improvements
- 🔹Add permission-level management (per-role authorization)
- 🔹Implement AJAX-based updates for smoother UX
- 🔹Add search, filters, and pagination in tables
- 🔹Generate downloadable reports (PDF / Excel)
- 🔹Enhance UI consistency and responsive behavior
